Check fenced code block flags.

Options: `Array.<string>` or `Object`, optional.

Providing an array is as passing `{flags: Array}`.

The object can have an array of `'flags'` which are deemed valid.
In addition it can have the property `allowEmpty` (`boolean`, default:
`false`) which signifies whether or not to warn for fenced code blocks
without language flags.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| ------ | ------- |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `{allowEmpty: false}` |

## Install

[npm][]:

```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 ...
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ...
     "lint",
+    "lint-fenced-code-flag",
     ...
   ]
 }
 ...
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-fenced-code-flag readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark');
 var report = require('vfile-reporter');

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-fenced-code-flag'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file));
   });
```
