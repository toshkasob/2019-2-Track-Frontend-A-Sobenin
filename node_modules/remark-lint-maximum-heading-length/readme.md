## Install

[npm][]:

```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 ...
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ...
     "lint",
+    "lint-maximum-heading-length",
     ...
   ]
 }
 ...
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-maximum-heading-length readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark');
 var report = require('vfile-reporter');

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-maximum-heading-length'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file));
   });
```
